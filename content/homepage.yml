  Just because your nonprofit’s mission doesn’t center on technology doesn’t mean your nonprofit won’t benefit from technology. With better tech your organization can reach more people, affect greater change, and put your donation dollars to better use. Ten-Forward is a dedicated group of software nerds looking to partner our expertise with your world-bettering vision.
  Your nonprofit isn’t a tech agency or a software firm. But ours is.
