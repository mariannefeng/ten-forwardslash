      ### THE OVERVIEW


      In November 2019, Ten-Forward presented a 2-hour workshop as a part of 501
      Commonsâ€™ 501 Talks Tech series on selecting WordPress plugins. We
      developed this workshop with an understanding that many nonprofits use
      WordPress for their sites, and most are extended with various plugins - of
      which there are over 50,000 overwhelming options.


      The first hour of this session focused on understanding use cases and
      requirements as a function in plugin selection, as well as some common
      research practices to employ when deciding between ones with similar
      functionality. By talking through the plugin selection process, we helped
      nonprofit employees to understand the value of use cases in requirements -
      a skill not limited to plugins.

      The second hour became a working session where the attendees could ask us
      specific questions related to their WordPress installations.

      ### THE TOPICS


      Topics we covered in the session extended beyond definitions of use cases
      and requirements. Once we went through use cases, we applied them to every
      step of the plugin selection process. The workshop also touched on common
      concerns regarding the CMS - how to begin to harden installations with
      basic security requirements and plugins, how to effectively back up sites
      through either hosting providers or plugins, as well as a basic navigation
      of the WordPress admin screen.

      ### THE IMPACT

      After the workshop, 501 Commons handed out surveys to the participants.
      They received 8 completed surveys. Of those who answered the question of
      whether or not they actively planned to use any of the skills or tools
      learned within the next six months, all but one responded that they would.
