      ### THE OVERVIEW

      In November 2019, Ten-Forward presented a 2-hour workshop as a part of 501
      Commons’ [501 Talks
      Tech](https://www.501commons.org/services/our-events-and-trainings/techtalk)
      series on selecting WordPress plugins. We developed this workshop with an
      understanding that many nonprofits use WordPress for their sites, and most
      are extended with various plugins - of which there are over
      [50,000](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) overwhelming options.


      The first hour of this session focused on understanding use cases and
      requirements as a function in plugin selection, as well as some common
      research practices to employ when deciding between ones with similar
      functionality. By talking through the plugin selection process, we helped
      nonprofit employees to understand the value of use cases in requirements -
      a skill not limited to plugins.

      The second hour became a working session where the attendees could ask us
      specific questions related to their WordPress installations.

      ### THE TOPICS


      Topics we covered in the session extended beyond definitions of use cases
      and requirements. Once we went through use cases, we applied them to every
      step of the plugin selection process. The workshop also touched on common
      concerns regarding the CMS - how to begin to harden installations with
      basic security requirements and plugins, how to effectively back up sites
      through either hosting providers or plugins, as well as a basic navigation
      of the WordPress admin screen.

      we created, as well as the [slide

      ### THE IMPACT

      After the workshop, 501 Commons handed out surveys to the participants.
      They received 8 completed surveys. Of those who answered the question of
      whether or not they actively planned to use any of the skills or tools
      learned within the next six months, all but one responded that they would.

      ### THE OVERVIEW

      [Cancer Happens](https://cancerpathways.org/education/cancer-happens/) is
      a cancer education and risk reduction program provided free of charge to
      middle schools and high schools nationwide. Student surveys are handed out
      before and after presentations to classrooms testing the students’
      knowledge across a wide variety of cancer-related topics.


      The goal of this collaboration is to help [Cancer
      Pathways](https://cancerpathways.org/) better organize and leverage
      student survey results for the Cancer Happens program to get both a
      clearer understanding of program impact as well as identify potential
      areas of program improvement.


      Over the course of 6 weeks, Ten-Forward built a data processing pipeline
      on top of G Suite. The *input* - raw student survey results, the *output*
      - live dashboards dissecting various aspects of the program, from cancer
      prevention actions the students will do as a direct result of the
      presentations to finding knowledge gaps across various cancer topics.

      ### 1: design

      The first deliverable: a process map clearly outlining activities that all
      involved parties perform in successful program implementation - from
      Cancer Pathways employees to the students. This is a crucial step in
      identifying necessary data to track in the new system as well as ensuring
      that both parties have a shared understanding of the program.

      We firmly believe that nonprofits understand their problem spaces the best
      - building the process map is a key piece in making sure that we have the
      right context before we dive into building solutions.

      Director - Mary - and us on the first day of project kickoff")

      Working alongside Cancer Pathways’ program director, we were able to
      identify 5 key use cases for the visualizations. Clear understanding of
      key processes coupled with vital visualization use cases formed the basis
      for a solid foundation in designing what data should be stored and how it
      is best structured.

      many) at how data might be best stored to support Cancer Pathways’ use
      cases")


      ### 2: build

      Clear data definitions are the precursor to determining inputs and outputs
      of the data processing pipeline. As raw student survey data is entered
      into Google Sheets, completed sets of survey results are moved into a
      Google Drive folder, where every night, all the raw survey responses are
      processed and transformed/aggregated as needed across 6 different
      resulting spreadsheets. These final spreadsheets were designed to fulfill
      the specific use cases that were discussed in the previous phase.

      ![screenshot example of student survey sheet
      headers](/images/uploads/raw-survey-headers.png "An example of headers
      from the raw survey response spreadsheet")

      With data correctly flowing into the right places thanks to the data
      processing pipeline, the final piece of build was creating up-to-date,
      interactive, and mobile-friendly visualizations.


      There are many different data visualization tools, and picking the right
      one is highly dependent on the use cases of the organization and the
      current toolkit they are employing. In the case of the Cancer Happens
      program, the cost of the tool, ease of use, integration with Google Suite,
      and their stage of data maturity led us to recommend Google Data Studio.

      ### 3: support

      Changing processes isn’t always easy, and in the month following the
      program, we provided
       a month of free support to aid in a smooth transition.

      In addition to general support, we also hosted a 2-hour workshop on Google
      Data Studio for the Cancer Pathways employees. This was a mixture of
      building example visualizations from scratch as well as sitting down with
      them and helping them explore visualizations they’ve had in mind for the
      latter half of the workshop. In-person training in the visualization tool
      is to ensure that they can continue to build on top of the framework we’ve
      laid out.


      A completely new system also meant a completely new workflow -- with this
      in mind, we created a documentation site using Google Sites with
      explanations of all the sheets, tutorials for common patterns, and guides
      for troubleshooting issues.

      ![screenshot of internal cancer happens documentation

      the new workflow, accessible only to users with cancerpathways.org
      emails")


      ### the impact

      The effects of a new workflow (especially one that introduces new tools)
      aren't always immediate. We'll be taking follow-up surveys every 6 months
      asking about the long-term effects of changes in internal program
      evaluations. Check back (or [subscribe to our mailing
      list](/contact#subscribe)!) as we update this page with results from our
      impact survey. In the meantime, here are some quotes we've gotten from the
      Cancer Happens team in our post-consult satisfaction survey:


      > “very well built database, great communication and response”


      > “you have helped us elevate our data entry process and analysis, which
      has enhanced our entire program!”


      > “Jessi and Marianne are incredibly skilled at what they do. They are
      also easy to work with and go above and beyond.”


      > “I have never had a higher level (or speed!) of comprehensive customer
      support from any vendor or partner than we have received from Ten
      Forward.  Hands down the best, most innovative, supportive, and genuine
      vendor I have ever worked with. Can't thank Ten Forward enough for their
      work that transformed our program and enabled us to elevate it to the next
      level.”
