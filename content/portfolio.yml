      # Workshop


      We were corporate software engineers, solving difficult problems at a
      leading-edge tech consultancy firm. However, we wanted to do more. We
      wanted to make a positive impact on the most pressing issues we
      saw—inequity for people, animals, and our planet. We didn’t have a clue on
      how to solve these problems, but we knew that thousands of you out there
      did.
