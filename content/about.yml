history: >-
  We were corporate software engineers, solving difficult problems at a
  leading-edge tech consultancy firm. However, we wanted to do more. We wanted
  to make a positive impact on the most pressing issues we saw—inequity for
  people, animals, and our planet. We didn’t have a clue on how to solve these
  problems, but we knew that thousands of you out there did. 




  Ten-Forward is a 501c3 founded in early 2018 in order to partner our
  experience and expertise in bleeding-edge technologies with your organization
  as you work tirelessly to build a better society. You’re making your
  organization’s vision a reality. We’re making sure the right tech gets into
  your hands to supercharge the process.
