mission: >-
  To help community-based organizations committed to building a more equitable
  society discover how technology can be used to boost their impact
vision: A just future realized through the social, economic, and political empowerment of all people
philosophy: >-
  To us, a just future is empowering all people with the resources they deserve.
  This means equitable access not limited to: education, healthcare, social services,
  financial services, the democratic process, and frankly, a whole list of other
  things that are probably missing from this list. We believe that equalizing access
  to resources is the first step in reforming institutionalized injustices.



  Problems that affect different communities can only be solved if members of those
  communities are an essential part of conversations and decisions that directly
  affect them, and we want to support like-minded organizations using the skills
  we’ve developed in the for-profit tech industry. Does our philosophy and mission
  align with yours? Do you have thoughts on how we can better serve you? Did we miss
  an important item in our equitable access list? We’re here to listen.
history: >-
  We were corporate software engineers, solving difficult problems at a
  leading-edge tech consultancy firm. However, we wanted to do more. We wanted
  to make a positive impact on the most pressing issues we saw—inequity for
  people, animals, and our planet. We didn’t have a clue on how to solve these
  problems, but we knew that thousands of you out there did.



  Ten-Forward is a 501c3 founded in early 2018 in order to partner our
  experience and expertise in bleeding-edge technologies with your organization
  as you work tirelessly to build a better society. You’re making your
  organization’s vision a reality. We’re making sure the right tech gets into
  your hands to supercharge the process.
